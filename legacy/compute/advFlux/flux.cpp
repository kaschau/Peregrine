// One advective flux composed by the jit. The kernel struct is PG_BASE: the
// reconstruction, PG_RECONSTRUCT (piecewiseConstant, muscl), which holds the
// columns and makes the two states at the face, and with shock capturing
// the switch on it, which weighs the face. PG_PRIMARY (a Riemann solver:
// rusanov, hllc, ausmPlusUp; a central scheme: KEPaEC) makes the flux of
// the states; with a switch, PG_SECONDARY is blended in by the weight,
// (1 - w) primary + w secondary, or, for a secondary that is a correction,
// added to the whole primary, weighing its own fields by the switch's
// sensors. Each is forced in ahead by the jit, and with muscl the limiter
// it slopes by, PG_LIMITER.
