# About

PEREGRINE is a multiblock, structured-grid multiphysics, finite volume, 3D CFD solver. The main novelty of PEREGRINE is its implementation in [Python](https://www.python.org) for ease of development and use of [Kokkos](https://www.github.com/kokkos/kokkos) for performance portability. If you are unfamiliar with Kokkos, do a little digging, it is a great project with a healthy community and helpful developers. The TLDR; on Kokkos is: Kokkos is a C++ library (not a C++ language extension) that exposes useful abstractions for data management (i.e. multidimensional arrays) and kernel execution from CPU-Serial to GPU-Parallel. This allows a single source, multiple architecture, approach in PEREGRINE. In other words, you can run a case with PEREGRINE on your laptop, then without changing a single line of source code, run the same case on a AMD GPU based super computer.

# Installation

For editable installation:

``` pip install -e . ```

Note, installation with pip is hard coded to Debug mode. I can't figure out how to make that an option.

For development, it is better to set the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` to point to `/path/to/PEREGRINE/src/peregrinepy` followed by manual installation of the compute module:

```cd /path/to/PEREGRINE; mkdir build; cd build; ccmake ../```

You must also install [Kokkos](https://www.github.com/kokkos/kokkos) and set the environment variable `Kokkos_DIR=/path/to/kokkos/install`. The Kokkos installation controls the Host/Device + Serial/Parallel execution parameters, there are no settings for the python installation.

To generate compile_commands.json, 

``` cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ../ ```

# Documentation

See the documentation [here](./docs/documentation.md).

# Profiling GPU via NVTX
Download and install the libraries found at
``` https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tools ```
At runtime, ensure the environment variable
``` export KOKKOS_PROFILE_LIBRARY=$HOME/software/sources/kokkos-tools/kp_nvprof_connector.so```
is set. Finally, run the simulation with nsys enabling cuda,nvtx trace options.
```jsrun -p 1 -g 1 nsys profile -o twelveSpecies30Cubed --trace cuda,nvtx  -f true --stats=false python -m mpi4py threeDTaylorProf.py```

# Performance

PEREGRINE is pretty fast by default. However, when running a simulation, it is recommended to turn on ```PEREGRINE_NSCOMPILE``` in cmake, and then specify the value of ```numSpecies```. This will hard code ```ns``` at compile time, and gives a considerable performance improvement for EOS/transport calculations.

# Parallel I/O 

Parallel I/O can be achieved with a parallel capable h5py installation. 

    $ export CC=mpicc
    $ export HDF5_MPI="ON"
    $ export HDF5_DIR="/path/to/parallel/hdf5"  # If this isn't found by default
    $ pip install h5py --no-binary=h5py
    
``` $HDF5_DIR ``` must point to a parallel enabled HDF5 installation. Parallel I/O is only applicable when running simulations with ```config["io"]["lumpIO"]=true```.
